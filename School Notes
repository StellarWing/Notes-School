January 17th - While Loops

Loops are structures that allow a program to repeat code. Use loops to automate tasks. 
while(condition) {
//code
}
A while loop repeats the code inside the braces over and over again, as long as the condition is true. Watch out for infinite loops, 
which are loops with conditions that are never become false. 

Example of infinite loop: 
int i = 0;
while(i < 10) {
//code
} 

Solution to example:
int i = 0;
while(i < 10) {
//code
i++;  //can use i + 1; too, this is what makes the code not infinite
}

Example #2 of infinite loop:
while (i != 10) { //!= means not equal to
//code;
i += 3; //can use i = i + 3;
} //the integer i can never reach the number 10, so therefore this code is always true since i never reach 10 and stop the code
